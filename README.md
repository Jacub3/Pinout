# Pinout
This an example repository for a microcontroller workshop

Remeber the pins are based off the GPIO number not the pin number on the board.

Repository 
- Led Magic

Steps:
Step 1: Circuit Python Website
  -Downloads -> .uf2 file for microcontroller
  -Pico/Picow  (you can tell based on the metal plate)
  -Libraries -> Bundles -> version 9.x
  
Step 2: VS code  
  -Download extension: circuit python V.2
    -There are three options choose V.2
    
Step 3: Microcontroller 
  -Locate your microcontroller in your library
    -How to: Press button on your microcontroller when plugging it into a computer to pair
  -Take the .u2f file from your downloads folder and drop it into the pico

Step 4: Stealing files
  -Go into 9.x file 
    -Go into lib file folder drag and drop into circuit python drive:
      -adafruit_ssd1306.mpy
      -adafruit_framebuf.mpy

Step 5: Download example code
